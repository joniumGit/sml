# SML

Simple Mathematical Language

### Work in progress

Aim is to have a language that has the following kind of syntax:

```
/* I am a comment */

IF variable IN (1 2 3) AND other_variable EQ 3 THEN DO;
    variable = 10;
END;
ELSE variable = 10;

variable = SUM(variable, variable, variable);
```
